1) **API Definition**: An API (Application Programming Interface) provides a "language" or set of rules that both the client (the requester of resources or services) and the server (the provider of resources or services) can understand. These rules define how the client and server should communicate.

2) **Rules Defined by the Server**: While it's true that the server defines the API's rules, the API itself is not limited to the server. The client and server must agree on the API's contract for communication to work smoothly. The API can specify request formats (e.g., JSON, XML), endpoints, methods (e.g., GET, POST), and response formats.

3) **Facilitation of Communication**: The API acts as a bridge to make client-server communication easier by abstracting the complexities of the underlying operations.
